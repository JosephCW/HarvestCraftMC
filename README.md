Goals:

Create a comprehensive Minecraft mod that adds many of the features available
in the popular farming simulator "Harvest Moon."

Current Focus:

- Plant, Crop, and Flower classes that change how farming works
- Fully featured cooking with multiple kitchen utilities and recipes
- Common farming blocks and mechanics (e.g. makers, incubators)
